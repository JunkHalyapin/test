    Jes "Do you have video from inside?"
    ODon "Nah. They disabled that feed before they got there."

    Jes "Do you think he listens to the police radio channels?"
    ODon "That wouldn't have been of much use in this case, the 911 call came after he had left."
    ODon "There it is, a nearby street camera."
    Jes "Can you sync up those two angles, showing us the side of the building when he appears?"
    ODon "No problem."
