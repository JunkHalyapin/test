    Jes "So this WAS the vigilante after all?"
    OSmi "I'm sure you and your people guessed it after reading the official report."
    Jes "We did, but I'm looking for something more. Something that's not in the official report."
    "Smith smiles and nods."

    OSmi "I can't give you much, but I can tell you what I know."

    OSmi "Sure."
    OSmi "The vigilante got into the warehouse last night and just kicked the shit out of these guys."
    Jes "Do you know what time it happened?"
    OSmi "Not sure, but some of the guys got a call just after midnight."
    Jes "The vigilante called them?"
    OSmi "I don't know. A guy called and said he heard some noises from the warehouse. When the units got here, they found a bunch of thugs tied up, just like before."
    Jes "The report said no one was killed."
    OSmi "Right. They were just beaten and bloody."

    Jes "Hello. Nice to meet you."
    "Jessica is used to reading people's eyes, and finds a confusing mixture of emotions in the detective. First surprise, then almost recognition."

    Mar "A friend, huh? Does that friend happen to be a journalist?"

    JesT "Does she know about my visit to the precinct?"

    Mar "Ms. O'Neil, you should leave this case alone and let us handle it."
    Mar "Go report on some corrupt politicians, or a bank fraud. This is dangerous."

    Jes "And since I'm here, you can either be stubborn and butt heads with me, or we can help each other."
    Mar "Help? And how can you help us, Ms. O'Neil? Do you have any information you want to share?"
    Jes "I just got here. Do you have anything to share with me?"
    Mar "That's not how it works. You have a journalistic obligation to share any details about this case you might have."
    JesT "I could tell her what I've found, about the bike, the warehouse, all that."
    JesT "But I'll reveal all my cards, and then I'll just continue chasing their tails along with everyone else."

    scene day8 ev02-21

    Jes "I thought so."

    Jes "What are you two working on?"
    Eve "We may have found a good lead for the construction case."

    Rosa "So we found a connection between the company that got the contract and a smaller company that closed down a few years ago."
    Rosa "That smaller company worked on a few public projects, one of which was the reconstruction of a local school."
    Rosa "We wanted to see if we could get some details about the job, see if something pops out at us."
    Rosa "The thing is, the public records are superficial and have basically zero details. We'd need to get the full records from the school administration."
    Rosa "And that's where you come in, since the school is Eastwick High."
    Jes "You want me to infiltrate my old high school?"
    Rosa "Not exactly. I was more hoping you knew someone there."
    Jes "Well, it was a while back, and I only went for one year before my family moved."
